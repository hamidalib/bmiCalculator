# bmiCalculator
A simple and responsive **BMI (Body Mass Index)** Calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users calculate their BMI based on height and weight inputs and receive instant results with health status (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, etc.).

This is a personal project where I plan to **experiment** and add more **features** in the future — such as unit toggles, result history, animations, and more.

**🚀 Features**
- Clean and minimal UI
- Instant BMI result with interpretation
- Basic input validation

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
